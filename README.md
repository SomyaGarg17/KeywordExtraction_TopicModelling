# Keyword Extraction and Topic Modelling App

This Streamlit application provides functionalities to analyze and summarize text. It offers a user-friendly interface to perform text analysis and summarization tasks, logging all actions for future reference.

Keywords summarize a document concisely and give a high-level description of the documentâ€™s content and Keyword extraction is a process in which you extract important keywords and phrases for analysis of texts and documents. Topic modelling is the process of categorizing text into a given topic which gives us an idea of what it is about without reading the whole text. This is very important as it saves time and give people a context.

## Features
